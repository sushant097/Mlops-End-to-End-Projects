# MLOps End-to-End Projects Repository

Welcome to the **MLOps End-to-End Projects** repository! This collection serves as a portfolio of end-to-end Data Science and Machine Learning projects with MLOps integration, demonstrating best practices for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models in production.

## üèÜ Repository Overview

The purpose of this repository is to showcase various MLOps projects that incorporate key principles such as **reproducibility**, **scalability**, and **automation**. Each project follows a structured workflow, integrating tools for data versioning, model tracking, and pipeline orchestration, providing a robust foundation for deploying machine learning solutions in real-world environments.

## üìÇ Projects

Each project in this repository is organized as a standalone module, complete with detailed documentation, code, and configuration files. The projects leverage a variety of MLOps tools and frameworks, including but not limited to DVC, MLflow, Docker, AWS,Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
